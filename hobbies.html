    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>As a dog, Oliver, apart from sleeping, enjoys doing the following things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stealing socks: he carefully takes socks from your bedroom, and drools them in his place.</li>
      <li>Wagging his tail every time he sees a familiar face.</li>
      <li>He loves barking at strangers. If the stranger pets him, he will immediately become his friend.</li>
      <li>Sleeping in your bed as if you had no right to be there.</li>
      <li>Sitting in your chair once you stand up.</li>
    </ul>
